# Paging Algorithms for Virtual Memory Application

This application demonstrates the functioning of different page replacement algorithms for virtual memory in computers. The following algorithms are supported: FIFO, LRU, Second Chance, LFU, and Optimal algorithm.

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Input the number of memory frames and the total number of memory references of the pages involved in the simulation.
2. Input the numerical labels of the pages that participate in the simulation in order.
3. Select one or more algorithms that will participate in the simulation.
4. Run the simulation.
5. View the results, including the number of Page Faults, i.e., the efficiency of individual algorithms.

## Supported Algorithms

1. FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
2. LRU (Least Recently Used)
3. Second Chance
4. LFU (Least Frequently Used)
5. Optimal algorithm
